## tako 

üêô tako is a Github notifier for Slack. It is written in Clojure and can be deployed to AWS  lambda.

## Why?

These are some (personal?) reasons to use tako:

- **Email kinda sucks**. By default Github sends you an email everytime someone creates a pull request or issue on a project you follow, or when you are mentioned, etc. Being an *inbox zero* freak myself, depending on email to stay on top of what's going on my your github account is rather cumbersome.
- **Slack does a decent job** You probably use it more than email anyway. Slack messages are easier to skim and keep clean. Most notifications don't require you to reply back.


## Requirements

- [lein](http://leiningen.org)
- A [Github token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- A [Slack Webhook URL](https://slack.com/apps/new/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks) pointing to a channel of your preference.

To run locally:

    lein run YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL

You can also create an jar with `lein uberjar`.

## Running from AWS lambda

In my current setup I have `tako` running on top of [AWS lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). This is why it is cool:

- [It is free](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/), at least for this use case. Since `tako` runs just a few times per hour, it will never be executed more than one million times a month (which is when Amazon starts charging you).
- You don't need to care about configure/maintain a server
- It is easy to update/deploy the code

There's one caveat though: AWS can be configured to run every N minutes; the minimum N is 5, so worst case scenario you receive the notifications 5 minutes after they were produced. Not a big deal for me, but worth taking into account.

That said, all you have to do is create a new AWS lambda function and configure it to run every 5 minutes. The steps are slightly modified from [this guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-scheduled-events.html):

0: Build a jar
```bash
git clone git@github.com:casidiablo/tako.git
cd tako
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your token
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=the slack webhook url
./build-jar

# a jar will be assembled in tako/target/tako.jar
```
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Lambda console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/
2. Choose Create a Lambda function.
3. In **Step 1: Select blueprint**, choose the **lambda-canary** blueprint.
4. In **Step 2: Configure event source**:
  - In **Event source type**, choose **CloudWatch Events - Schedule**.
  - In **Name** type a name (for example, **Github Poller**). Then, this name appears in the list of event sources in the console.
  - In **Schedule expression**, specify **rate(5 minutes)**.
5. In **Step 3**: Configure function, do the following:
  - Set the function name to `tako`
  - In **Runtime**, specify *Java 8*
  - In **Handler** type `tako.core::handler`
  - In **Role**, choose basic execution role.
  - In the **Lambda function code**, choose the jar produced in step `0`
  - In **Memory (MB)**, set the dropdown to 256
  - In **Timeout**, configure it to be 30 seconds
6. In **Step 4: Review**, review the configuration and then choose **Create Function**. The function must look [like this](http://i.imgur.com/3tduRGF.png).

### Updating code

You can upload changes from the command line by running:

    # make sure you have awscli installed and configured
    ./lambda-deploy

Or by building a new jar and uploading it manually using the AWS web console.
